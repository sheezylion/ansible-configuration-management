# ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT (AUTOMATE PROJECT 7 TO 10)
In Projects 7 to 10 we perform a lot of manual operations to set up virtual servers, install and configure required software and deploy our web application.

This Project will make us appreciate **DevOps tools** even more by making most of the routine tasks automated with

at the same time we will become confident with writing code using declarative languages such as YAML.

## Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bastion Host)
A **Jump Server** (sometimes also referred as **Bastion Host**) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided. If you think about the current architecture you are working on, ideally, the webservers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet. That means, even DevOps engineers cannot SSH into the Web servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server - it provides better security and reduces attack surface.

## Task
- Install and configure Ansible client to act as a Jump Server/Bastion Host
- Create a simple Ansible playbook to automate servers configuration

On the diagram below the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is divided into two subnets - Public subnet has public IP addresses and Private subnet is only reachable by private IP addresses.

### Step 1 - Install and Configure ANSIBLE ON EC2 Instance

#### 1. Update Name tag on your Jenkins EC2 Instance to Jenkins-Ansible. We will use this server to run playbooks.

#### 2. In your GitHub account create a new repository and name it ansible-config-mgt

#### 3. Instal Ansible

```
sudo apt update
```

Result:

```
sudo apt install ansible
```

Result:

#### Check your ansible version

```
ansible --version
```

Result:

#### 4. Configure Jenkins build job to save your repository content every time you change it â€“ this will solidify your Jenkins configuration skills acquired in Project 9

- Configure a Webhook in GitHub and set the webhook to trigger ansible build. On ansible-config-mgt repository, select Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook

Result:

- Create a new Freestyle project ansible in Jenkins
